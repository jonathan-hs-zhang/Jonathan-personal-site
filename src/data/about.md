# Intro


Hi, I'm Haosen Zhang (张皓森), also known as Jonathan Zhang. I'm a recent graduate, having obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of British Columbia in 2023. Currently, I am actively seeking positions in FPGA, Firmware, or hardware engineering. If you're interested in learning more about me or my experiences, please feel free to reach out to me at zhanghaosen328@gmail.com.
# Some history

- On November 26, 2001, I was born in Shenyang, China, a beautiful provincial capital city in the northeast of China.

- Throughout my childhood, I lived a typical life like any other child in China: focused on studying, exploring musical instruments like the flute and accordion, and relocating to different cities within China, including Shenyang, Haicheng, and Dalian.

- At the age of 14, I entered high school, and my interests began to evolve. I developed a keen interest in psychology, even going as far as reading entire textbooks on social psychology.

- By 16, I realized that while psychology fascinated me, it wasn't necessarily an ideal subject to pursue in college. This realization led me to develop a stronger interest in material engineering.

- At 17, I took the Chinese Gaokao and achieved outstanding grades. Simultaneously, I received an offer from UBC, along with an exceptional international student award, including a $20,000 scholarship.

- Upon turning 18, I decided to pursue electrical engineering as my academic focus and dedicated myself to my studies at university.

- At 21, I successfully graduated from university and began actively searching for employment opportunities, a journey that continues to this day.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
